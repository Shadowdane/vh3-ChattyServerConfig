This is a customized configuration for the Vault Hunters 3.16.x Minecraft Modpack!   This configuration is used on the Official Chatty Vault Hunters SMP.
Our server uses the Easy Vault Difficulty, this configuration is mainly aimed at the Easy difficulty to better balance it.  It might not be the best fit if your playing on harder difficulty settings.

I wasn't originally intending to upload this to Github, so I didn't keep track of all the configuration changes.   Below is a general summary of configuration changes.
